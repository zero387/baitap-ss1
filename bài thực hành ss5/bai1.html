    <h2>WHhat is CSS</h2>
    <strong>cascading style sheets (CSS) is used to fommat the layout of a webpage</strong>
    <p id="text1">When tags like <font>, and color attributes were added to 
        the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a 
        nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, 
        where fonts and color information were added to every single 
        page, became a long and expensive process.</p> 
    <p id="text2">
        CSS is used to <span>define</span> styles for your web pages,
         including
         the design, layout and variations 
        in display for different devices and screen sizes.
